		<p>	I saw a lot of cool people have their personal websites so I wanted to make one myself. 
			I'm actually pretty bad at writing (and website making) so starting a blog could be good practice!
			Also recently I have gotten an allotment and have been planting some stuff. 
			It would be fun to keep an allotment diary to track the growths of my plants.
			Other than that maybe I will also write about travels here. I guess it's just fun to have a place to post whatever is on your mind.
			That said, I am already unsure what else to write in my first blog. 
			The website is pretty bland and ugly at the moment, but I am thinking maybe I should add tabs for different kind of things.
