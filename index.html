			<h2>Allotment Diary 4/30</h2>

				Here is a picture of my allotment at the moment. Not long has passed since I sowed the seeds.
				We sowed the seeds in the green house on 14th of April, and sowed the seeds in the allotment on 15th of April.
				The Allotment contains three lines of crops, the radishes are sowed on the left. 
				It can be seen on the picture that they seem to be the only ones that has sprouted! 
				The middle contains spring onions, and the right contains garlics. 
				I was worried that garlic and spring onions are eaten by birds, so I dug around trying to find them and found that they are still there.
				They have been growing roots (Just haven't sprouted yet). I guess you can't be impatient with the crops. 
				We have newly sowed some broadbeans on the top and bottom of the allotment.

				The other two pictures are of the crops I have sowed in the green house. They are cabbages and squash. 
				My brother also sowed some flowers in the green house, but they haven't grown yet. 
				The squash grew much faster than I expected, it was such a nice surprise.
				Something interesting that I discovered is that the cabbage sprouts look very similar to radish sprouts. 
				They both have two leaves that shape like a small heart. It got me thinking that perhaps they are related in some ways, and so I google and found that they do in fact both belong to the Brassicaceae family!
				This family also includes broccoli, bok choi, and kale. 
				It's quite interesting to think that they can look so similar as babies and yet grow into vastly different plants.
				Just like how human embryos look similar to those of chicken's, and yet we grow into such different creatrues!

		<h2>My first blog</h2>
		<h5>Apr 30, 2023</h5>
		<!-- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div> -->
		<p>	I saw a lot of cool people have their personal websites so I wanted to make one myself. 
			I'm actually pretty bad at writing (and website making) so starting a blog could be good practice!
			Also recently I have gotten an allotment and have been planting some stuff. 
			It would be fun to keep an allotment diary to track the growths of my plants.
			Other than that maybe I will also write about travels here. I guess it's just fun to have a place to post whatever is on your mind.
			That said, I am already unsure what else to write in my first blog. 
			The website is pretty bland and ugly at the moment, but I am thinking maybe I should add tabs for different kind of things.
